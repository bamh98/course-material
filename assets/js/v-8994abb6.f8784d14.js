That&#39;s why we recommend you to get continuos feedback on your work throughout the entire course by discussing it with a teacher at the lab sessions.</p><p>When marking the final submission of your work we need to read through and assess your work. Marking your work is not a <em>teaching activity</em>, but an <em>examination</em>, so our feedback on your final submissions are not intended for you, but rather something we use ourselves to justify the grade we give you. But since it&#39;s also very valuable for you as a student to read it, I often share my feedback with you, so you can learn what you can improve. Since the feedback primarily is for me, <strong>my feedback on your work might be hard for you to read, and they might overall be incomplete</strong>.</p><h2 id="report-feedback" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#report-feedback" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Report Feedback</h2><p>If you&#39;ve submitted a report (PDF), I will write my feedback as (PDF) comments in it.

I also tend to only comment on the things you have written, and not so much on all the things you should have written, but haven&#39;t.</p><h2 id="code-feedback" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#code-feedback" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Code Feedback</h2><p>If you&#39;ve submitted code, I&#39;ll read through <strong>parts of it</strong> and make note of anything I find suspicious/incorrect. You&#39;ll later receive these notes. If I find too severe mistakes preventing you from getting a passing grade I usually stop looking for more mistakes, so <strong>students that need to improve their work often need to improve more things than just the things I&#39;ve commented on</strong>.</p><h2 id="final-grade" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#final-grade" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Final Grade</h2><p>The final grade I give you on your work is not only based on my written feedback. While looking through your work I&#39;ll also assess your work per the grading guidelines (available in most of my courses), and I&#39;ll also assess how well your work is overall. All of this is then taken into account for the final grade.</p><h2 id="revisions" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#revisions" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Revisions</h2><p>The students who need to improve their work to get a passing grade often wants a &quot;minimal list with things to fix to get a passing grade&quot;. My feedback is no such list. The closest you&#39;ll get to such a list is by reading through the project instructions, the hinting text in the project report template and the project grading guideline. Together they should give you a very good understanding of what&#39;s required to receive a passing grade.</p><p>It might not be necessary for you to fix all the things I&#39;ve commented on to get a passing grade. When you submit your revision I&#39;ll make a new assessment of your entire work from scratch. This time it might overall be good enough to get a passing grade. I strongly recommend you to fix all the things I&#39;ve commented on, but if you want to gamble it&#39;s up to you.</p><div class="custom-container warning"><p class="custom-container-title">I&#39;ll miss commenting on some bad things</p><p>When I read through a revision I might notice mistakes/errors that were there already in the first submission, but I never commented on. For the student, that <strong>does not mean</strong> <em>I don&#39;t need to fix that since you didn&#39;t comment on it before, so I had no idea that it was something I needed to fix</em>. To learn what you need to deliver to pass, read through the project instructions, the project grading guidelines and the hints in the report template.</p></div><p>Many students often submit revisions 1-2 hours after they&#39;ve received my feedback. Most likely it will take more than 1-2 hours to improve the work to make it good enough to receive a passing grade. These students often also want me to mark their submissions as soon as they have submitted their revisions. That will not happen. The deadlines for submitting revisions are at the same time as for the re-exam of the written examination (if not stated otherwise), and that&#39;s when I&#39;ll mark your submitted revisions.</p><p>The reason we only mark your work at specific deadlines is to avoid students submitting revisions with small changes again, and again, and again, until it&#39;s good enough to pass. It takes too much time for us teachers to mark revisions. By only marking your work at specific deadlines we:</p><ul><li>Encourage students to submit proper work (since most of them don&#39;t want to wait until the next submission occasion to receive a passing grade).</li><li>Avoid wasting time on marking unnecessary many revisions.</li></ul>',12),c={},m=(0,o(3744).Z)(c,[["render",function(e,t){const o=(0,n.up)("OutboundLink");return(0,n.wg)(),(0,n.iD)(n.HY,null,[a,(0,n._)("div",i,[r,(0,n._)("p",null,[s,(0,n._)("a",d,[h,(0,n.Wm)(o)]),l])]),u],64)}]])},3744:(e,t)=>{t.Z=(e,t)=>{const o=e.__vccOpts||e;for(const[e,n]of t)o[e]=n;return o}},2581:(e,t,o)=>{o.r(t),o.d(t,{data:()=>n});const n={key:"v-8994abb6",path:"/lectures/peters-feedback/",title:"Peter's Feedback",lang:"en-US",frontmatter:{sidebar:"auto",navbarTitle:"Peter's Feedback"},excerpt:"",headers:[{level:2,title:"Report Feedback",slug:"report-feedback",children:[]},{level:2,title:"Code Feedback",slug:"code-feedback",children:[]},{level:2,title:"Final Grade",slug:"final-grade",children:[]},{level:2,title:"Revisions",slug:"revisions",children:[]}],filePathRelative:"lectures/peters-feedback/README.md",git:{updatedTime:159161603e4}}}}]);
